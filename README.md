# rabbitmq-tutorial

I started this small project as an example of learning something by playing with it.

The initial idea was to create an imaginary supplier and a couple of imaginary stores that communicate with each other through a pretty real RabbitMQ.

The whole idea collapsed when I found myself trying to remember how to create razor forms, antiforgery tokens and other stuff that is absolutly irrelevant to RabbitMQ.

But in the end I was able to get this to work. Not as nice as I imagined it but at least I know how to create basic consumers and producers in .net core web api/mvc applications.

This will be a reminder that some ideas require too much of side work to play with a tiny thing.
